This application is designed, in part, to be a showcase of the [Scattered-Systems, LLC](https://scsys.io) ecosystem of custom solutions empowering user to confidently explore the next generation of internet based solutions. Every instance of the software is extremely malleable thanks to a modular architecture and unique orchestration model, automatically injecting the necessary components directly into the registered namespace.

| subdomain       | description |
|:----------------|:------------|
| `@`             | The **root** of the namespace is a fully-controlled application (blog, portfolio, store, etc.) designed by and for user and their interests. |
| `api`           | Various apis that enable the platform and its capabilities. |
| `app`           | The context-based, semi-public workspace equipped to handle a myriad of experiences |
| `ctx`           | A **contextual** sub-domain housing a context management system enabling so-called composite contexts; essentially, a novel authentication mechanism |
| `space`         | The **space** endpoint manifests the _internal_ view of the owners digital universe providing them with direct access and control over their assets, resources, systems, etc.  |

This allows the user to seamlessly navigate between the various components of their digital universe, all while maintaining a consistent and cohesive experience customized to suite their needs. All of this enables the system to provide a powerful and flexible multi-platform experience that is truly unique to each user. The native application provides even more access and control for the user, providing them with granular control over their digital assets and resources, as well as the ability to manage and orchestrate their entire digital universe from a single, unified interface.
